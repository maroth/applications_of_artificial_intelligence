Jass
===========
Inaccessible: I don't know who has which cards
Determinstic: There are clear rules for the card game
Nonepisodic: I need to remember which cards where played to calculate chances
Static: Only one player plays at a time
Multi-Agent: I am playing against other players (agents)

Jass Subtasks
===========
Calculate probability of which other player has which card
Analyze cards in your hand
Descend in game tree, giving each possible outcome a score
Heuristic for leafs of game tree descent
Rule Engine and Winning conditions



Building a house
===========
Inaccessible: In the real world, we neber know the entire environment
Stochastic: In the real world, nothing is ever completely deterministic.
Nonepisodic: Knowing what is inside a wall or under a floor is very relevant to the further construction.
Dynamic: Concrete hardens, rocks fall, wind blows.
Continuous: The real world is clearly continuous.
Single-Agent: I can reasonably expect to be the only agent working on constructing the house

House Building Subtasks
===========
Analyze the ground and consistency beneath it
dig hole
lay foundation
set concrete
create windows and doors
put in plumbing
...




MASON: Ant Foraging
===========

Inaccessible: If each ant had access to complete state of the environment, the exercise of finding the food makes no sense. Each ant only knows its immediate surroundings.
Deterministic: Nothing happens in the world except agents moving, exreting pheromones, and pheromones diminishing. Pheromone behaviour might as well be modelled stochastically.
Episodic: Only the current state of the pheromones will guide the ant movements, previous steps are not relevant.
Static: This depends on whether you consider each and seperately, or all ants as an agent. But as all of the world is simulated, and nothing happens that is not in the simulation loop, we can consider this a static problem.
Discrete: The simulated world is clearly discrete, as ants can only move exactly one pixel in four directions in a game turn.
Multi-Agent: Many Ants = Many Agents


MASON: Light Cycles
===========
Accessible: Agents and any human player know the entire map
Deterministic: There is no randomness in the game
Episodic: The entire history is visible at any point in time, so no memory is needed
Dynamic: Your cycle moves as you are thinking
Discrete: Pixel-by-Pixel movement
Muli-Agent: Many Players in the game


MASON: Woims
===========
Accessible: Obstacles and other worms are always known
Deterministic: No randomness in game
Episodic: History not relevant
Dynamic: Worms move all the time
Discrete: Pixel by Pixel movement
Multi-Agent: There are many woims
